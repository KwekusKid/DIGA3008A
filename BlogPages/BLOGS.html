<h3> Week 2</h3>
<h5>Reading of the week: Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’.</h5><br>
<h4>Reflection on the reading:</h4>
<p>Moulthrop's "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media" is a cultural and socially analysis on the media hyptertext. Moulthrop defines Hypertext as an interactive electronic text, that separates itself
    from the then dominate text of print through its non linearity. He analyzes hypertext through the lens of Marshall Mcluhan's laws of media to measure hypertext as revolutionary media. He puts hypertext through the 4 questions of, What does the media intensify or enhance, 
    what does it render obsolete/displace, what does it retrieve that was obsolete, and what does it become when taken to its limits? In terms of reflection and comparisons to the internet today I decided to ask all questions about AI. Specifically AIs who are used by the public for information such as Chatgpt and DeepSeek.
    These AI's have taken center stage when it comes to internet discourse. 
    <ul><h5>What does it intensify/enhance?</h5></ul>
        <p>Hypertext: Moulthrop believed hypertext enhanced connectivity, interactivity and reader agency. When compared to print at the 
            time, hyptertext gave readers a lot more options where and when they're getting their information from. Hypertext also encouraged reader
            participation in terms of the spreading of knowledge. It also help balance the scale in terms of who had control over knowledge at a time when
            print was ran by major publishing corporations
        </p>
        <p>AI: AI enhances the speed at which we receive more information as well as it packages the information in such a way that it's easier to process. AI also learns and adapts
            from the user, creating a personalized learning experience. In terms of issues of revolution, AI's sort of customer first position, aids in the development of 
        dangerous thought echo chambers. A huge issue on the internet today. </p>
        <ul><h5>What does it render obsolete/displace?</h5></ul>
        <p>Hypertext: Displaced linear, print based reading. Moulthrop however, did push the arguement that Hypertext also challenged TV
            even more so than another text media, books, he saw hypertext and books as media that drew their engagement from text and used that deep engagement to challenge the passive nature of Tv.
            In the end however, due to political and economic factors, most hypertext was reduced to one to many broadcast, search engines like Google or Yahoo for example, leaving hyptertext in the passive state it once challenged. 
        </p>
        <p>AI: Ironically speaking AI threated what hypertext became, these massive one to many search engines. AI threatens search engines and other places where 
            people can manual get information, that includes libraries which already took a huge hit from search engines themselves. Which is dangerous because AI don't have proper verification mechanisms like academic journals. AI aso threatens real life jobs of
            researchers assistants and journalists. While hypertext of the of the past was once a source or even platform for such occupations. 
        </p>
        <ul><h5>What does it retrieve that was obsolete</h5></ul>
        <p>Hypertext: Hyptertext brought back networking and community in terms of the gathering of knowledge. Print culture at the time had taken away the interconnectedness of how knowledge was gathered, large publishing agencies had control of what was said, who said it and when.</p>
        <p>AI:AI brought back dynamic conversationally learning. Not in its truest form because of its bias towards the users, as in its not willing to go out of its way to inform the user
            but more so satisfy them. However, it did bring back the idea of knowledge being built from specific questions being asked and them being answered critically with a combination of researched answers. In terms of comparing AI and Hypertext, hypertext was much better for communal learning
        a form of learning that, yes, has the potential to be less conversationally but has more potential to be deeper and more memorable for the user.  </p>
       <ul><h5>What does it become when taken to its limit?</h5></ul>
       <p> Researching and doing the reading lead me to understand that in a capitalist society, the spreading maintaining and gathering of knowledge and media that excel at that will always 
        fall into the hands of the powerful and wealthy. Both these media when taken to their limits are unfortunately at worst, tools to maintain hegemony and at best under the control of those who's best interest lies in the maintaining of hegemony.
        Both forms of media should be decentralized and democratized for the people and from their we'll truly see their potential and thw limits they can reach.

<h3>Week 3</h3>
<p><h4>Progress on my website</h4>

    <article>My user Alignment: I am going for a centered vertical user alignment. I picked this approach because I believe it best suits the structure I want for this website. I want to aim for a website where there is never a sense of overwhelming information on the user's screens. On my home page specifically, all I want is a list of the different pages my site will hold, BLOGS, PORTFOLIO, DESIGN, and PROFILES.  I want the website to be clean and efficient.
