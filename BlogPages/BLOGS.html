    <article>My user Alignment: I am going for a centered vertical user alignment. I picked this approach because I believe it best suits the structure I want for this website. I want to aim for a website where there is never a sense of overwhelming information on the user's screens. On my home page specifically, all I want is a list of the different pages my site will hold, BLOGS, PORTFOLIO, DESIGN, and PROFILES.  I want the website to be clean and efficient.
