        <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <h3> My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to pages</h3>
       <p>- Navigating GitHub is still a challenge, I feel I never got to understand it from a fundamental standpoint. I have a lot of questions, like what is pages? I dont really understand what publishing really means, and many more embarassing ones.<br>
       I do think all of it is cool, just the idea of coding an enitre website from stractch excites and I'm pretty to excited to learn about that process. </p><br>
       

       <h3>Reflections on the readings and my experience of the internet today</h3>
       <p>The readings I selected was 'proposal for a universal electronic system and archive(from literary machines 1981)'. This reading looked at and expanded on the idea presented by Ted Nelson of a ever expanding computer network that contains all the literture of the world. Basically the worlds greatest archive, it explores how the netwokr would be made on both a techincal and conceptual level. He called the project Xanadu and wanted it to hold all literture. And to explore that the reading looked into what literture is and the idea of a linkage system.
        I really enjoyed how the reading defined literture as ongoing system of interconnecting documents. They talked about how all literture is connected even to the point of a child simpling writing something on a piece of paper, because even what they wrote still comes from somewhere. That really shifted my perspective on writing and on a grander scale how I view humanity as a whole and our constant ability to learn and grow as a result of our connections to one another.
        To connect all these different strains of literure, the reading explores the idea of a linkage system as well as a Eletronic literary systems. Linkage systems were seen as invisible lines that contect different documents together. Think of the search bar feature on tiktok. When on Tiktok and a video pops, if during that video and throughout the video's comment section a certain group of words or topic is brought up a siginficant amount of times then users have an easy way to search up said topic through two options. One is a grey search bar at the bottom of the video that when pressed by a user will automatically search the words on tiktok. And the other option is if a comment under the video clealry states the words/topic then it will become a blue comment which users can click on to instantly search tiktok for the words or topic. Weather or not users find exactly what theyre looking for is another issue but I think this form of hypermedia is exatcly what Ted wanted for his linkage system of Xanadu. 
        Another topic discussed in the reading I also really enjoyed was the idea of an electronic literatry system. One thing the reading said about this system was that they wanted it to be simple and easy for users to navigate 
    which I found really cool as a design goal because even now in 2025, 20 years since Nelsons realese of the theory and even more since the realease of <i>literary machines 1981</i> that has always been the goal of those involved in interactive media and user interface. But speaking on what the literarty system was. Nelson wanted it that each document not only had multiple copies being easy to access and trace but every change and version to be tracked and saved as well. He believed this would be vital in developing literure as it would allow authors to expand on and look at the different possibilities and shapes all their writing could take.
He wanted that changes and different versions of documents had theur own index. This also applied to ideas beyond literture, pcitures, videos as well as graphical data structures were to all have the system in place.</p>

<h5>The internet archive</h5>
<p>Overall I dont have that much to speak on in terms of my experience on the internet, I google words i dont understand and read articles my sister or tiktok recommends me. thats pretty much me summed up as a user of the internet. however I really do lime the idea of cool interesting corners of the internet.
    websites that are underground and sort of obsecure for example, window snap. A site where people just live stream their windows and where their are, if they choose to, I love sites discovering sites like this and it makes me wish I sort of grew up on the internet more. But one site I really wanted to talk about and as a result of the readings was Internet Archive, which is a non-profit digtal library filled with millions of texts, audios, pictures and more 
    its used by academics, researchers and the public. Its mission is to provide universal access to knowledge.          </p>
