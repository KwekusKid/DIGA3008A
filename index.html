        <h>Week 1</h>
    </sh> My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to pages</sh> 
       <p>- Navigating GitHub is still a challenge, I feel I never got to understand it from a fundamental standpoint. I have a lot of questions, like what is pages? I dont really understand what publishing really means, and many more embarassing ones.</p><br>
       <p>I do think all of it is cool, just the idea of coding an enitre website from stractch excites and I'm pretty to excited to learn about that process. </p><br>
