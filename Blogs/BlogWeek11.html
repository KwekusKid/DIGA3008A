Theres almost an exhausting nature to the overwhelming effects of neo colonial capitalism, most especially in research towards digital inequalities.
Christoph Lutz in <i>Digital inequalities in the age of artificial intelligence and big data</i> breaks down the effects of emerging technologies, primarily big data and 
artificial intelligence,  on the 
studies of digital inequalities. Using a wide range of rich literature on the topic, Lutz analyzes the effects of big data and artificial intelligence 
on the three levels of digital divide. The first level focusing on the inequalities in access to the emerging technologies, the second level focuses on 
inequalities in the skills necessary to use the digital technologies and the third level on the benefits and who gets them from the digital technologies. 
What I wanted to reflect on in relation to the article was the overwhelming nature of living in a hyper productive, hyper industrialized late stage
capitalist society. With the rise of the data driven zeitgeist infesting technological spaces, its entirely unfair to speak people to come up with the skills
to keep with technologies they have no access to and no access to the understanding of the technology. Theres a rate at which technology is changing and evolving 
,despite its harming to marginalized groups, that is out of control, I commend Lutz for his tenacity to question and critic digital inequalities scholarship
however, I fear the rate of the technological evolution lies as the deeper issue. 
<p class = "divider"></p>
Technological evolution without the conscious understanding of inclusivity but more a 
product for only a small group in society to me isn't a true form of evolution especially when it comes at the detriment of others. The legitimacy of the technological evolution comes to question
because, thanks to studies like Lutz's majority of world cant use the product. In terms of first level digital divides, content availability and functionally for marginalized groups 
stand at the for front of issues to be faced(Lutz 2019). Speaking on the second level, algorithmic literacy and the tracking and understanding of user engagement is a young study strand of study
within digital inequalities academia(Lutz 2019) thats yet to even come close to identifying the real world social implications of algorithmic based content online. On the third level, Lutz questions who's been getting harmed 
by these emerging technologies being developed not only who benefits, he believe this question and research into would work will with upcoming studies on privacy risk and surveillance under capitalism. 
All these concerns out the average gains we've gotten from emerging technologies and their evolution and the rate of is something that cant be control, it is a factor we need to look, before it is too late.
