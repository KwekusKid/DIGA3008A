            <h4>Pro's </h4>
            <p>
                It's a website that doesn't have a lot of functions, which allows for a review of its intent to be much easier than something like a banking website in which they have many sections and functions. 
                There's clearly a company ethos and that is apparent throughout the colour scheme, typography and visuals 
                 There's a hastiness about how its designed, its not a website you're meant to spend a lot of time on, unless you're deciding on what to eat but other than that its quick and clean.

Its basic and a bit uninspired. It doesn't really push and web design conventions 
Some of the visuals aren't entirely coherent.
