               Firstly,  I want to get better at identifying coding practices that perpetuate colonialism. There's few I understand fully such as 
               ignoring or not taking priority of local data. In this data driven society, I want to acknowledge local communities who will engage with 
               my website and hopefully give them an enriching experience that is applicable to their context. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Secondly I want my website to have a deeper understanding of the context of my target audience and shape or form how can I enrich 
                their context with my website. specifically in the long run, I would love to introduce a language feature specifically for different 
                South African languages, where in which users on entry to my website can decide what language best suits their needs. 
            </p>

            <p class = "divider"></p>
            <p>
                What changes have I made to incorporate javascript?
            </p>
