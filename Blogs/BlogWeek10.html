               <div class = "divider"></div>
                <p>
                    An article that looks at hegemonies established by the bias's of search engines. 
                    The article explores how much your search engine takes your geographical information into consideration. 
                    It also explores the geographical ranges of your search results, asking which countries pop up the most on result pages and where do these countries pop up.
                    They look at a sample of countries and within each they do a google search of each country's capital and from there analyze locally produced content that appears on the result page as well as international content and tele the percentage of local and international.  
                    The URL query parameter of ql played an important role in this study, the ql parameter emphasizes results from a particular country the user finds themselves in. 
    
                    This reading showed me potential of hegemonic systems leap frogging from our everyday socio economic lives into our digital realms, and once again much like its real world counter part, this leap frog is a result of objective systems. 
                    In the conclusion of the study, its said that majority of wealthy and well connected countries retain hegemonic structures on Google. They list two key factors for this:
                    first, countries in the global south have just not produced enough content. Countries in the global south are producing content at a much lower rate that those of the global north and second Google algorithms favour central web content, pages that are linked to other pages. 
                    And much like other systems that sustain hegemonic systems, those a top have these systems which leaves the disadvantaged between a rock and hard place.
