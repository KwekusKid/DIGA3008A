        <h4>Thoughts and IxD design</h4>
        <ul> <li><p>My goal alignment for both my website and target audience: I want to have the perfectly balance between a website that holds its own 
            experience that one users should be prepare for and ready to engage with while also having a website with cohesive interface elements as well as
            consistent and transparent content structure. The navigation must be simple while maintaining a feeling of discovery. I essentially want to create a world in my website
            but one thats easy to traverse.
     </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Hicks law and Balance in my website: Hicks law speaks on how the time a person takes to make a decision increases based on the number
            of and complexity of the choices. Balance in terms of the composition of refers to the positions of the subject in frame, or in this context the screen, and how they are 
        positioned to create harmony. Why are these two concepts important ? Last week in my blog <a href = "BlogWeek3.html">Week 3</a> I spoke about 
    the value of space in my website. This space allows for users to take in my works, vision and world of my website. I spoke on how white as a backdrop creates this space.
    Hicks Law and the idea of balance join this conversation. Balance allows for clarity in the mind of my user, making it easier for them to process and make decisions when traversing my site.
    This leads back to Hicks Law on the complexity of the decisions. When my site is well balanced, weather that  be symmetrical, asymmetrical or radial. Users will find it
    easy to process my website and therefore it'll be easier for them to make decisions on my website and not feel overwhelmed.</p>

<h4>Reflections and my website so far</h4>
<section>
    <p>My wireframes</p>

<p> <img src = "../Images/Wireframe.jpg" alt = "My first wireframe" width = "500" height = "600">  
    <img src = "../Images/Add a heading.png" alt = "High fidelity" width = "500" height = "600">

    Over the course of this and really good look at my inspirations,  do believe my final website might end up not looking like either one of these wireframes.
    Howecer I do want to highlight characteristics I will be keeping from each and where my head was at when I designed each.
