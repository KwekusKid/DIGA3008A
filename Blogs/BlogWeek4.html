                <ul> <li><p>My goal alignment for both my website and target audience: I want to have the perfectly balance between a website that holds its own 
                    experience that one users should be prepare for and ready to engage with while also having a website with cohesive interface elements as well as
                    consistent and transparent content structure. The navigation must be simple while maintaining a feeling of discovery. I essentially want to create a world in my website
                    but one thats easy to traverse.
             </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Hicks law and Balance in my website: Hicks law speaks on how the time a person takes to make a decision increases based on the number
                    of and complexity of the choices. Balance in terms of the composition of refers to the positions of the subject in frame, or in this context the screen, and how they are 
                positioned to create harmony. Why are these two concepts important ? Last week in my blog <a href = "BlogWeek3.html">Week 3</a> I spoke about 
            the value of space in my website. This space allows for users to take in my works, vision and world of my website. I spoke on how white as a backdrop creates this space.
            Hicks Law and the idea of balance join this conversation. Balance allows for clarity in the mind of my user, making it easier for them to process and make decisions when traversing my site.
            This leads back to Hicks Law on the complexity of the decisions. When my site is well balanced, weather that  be symmetrical, asymmetrical or radial. Users will find it
            easy to process my website and therefore it'll be easier for them to make decisions on my website and not feel overwhelmed.</p>

        <p>Over the course of these past weeks and after a really good look at my inspirations,  I do believe my final website might end up not looking like either one of these wireframes.
            However, I do want to highlight significant characteristics within each wireframe and where my head was at when implementing them.
        <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
            The vertical alignment: Throughout both wireframes I wanted that all the content displayed on the screen followed a vertical alignment 
            and had a radial balance towards the content. at the time my inspiration of Deon Hinton's portfolio, <a href="https://www.okdeon.com/about" target="_blank">Deon Hinton Portfolio</a>, 
            I noticed a lot verticality but most of all I noticed a lot white space. I believed vertically in my website would achieve this.
        </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <p>
            The capital letters my the overall syntax of my website: I want my website to be bold and sort of in your face but not in a distracting way more so
            in a way that allows users to know they're experiencing something different, something that will challenge them.
        </p>
        
        </li>
        
        <li>
        <p>
            My old navigation system: Throughout my design process I was drawn to the idea of a centralized home/navigation tool
            that would feature in every homepage. I essentially wanted that the website was just packed into this navigation tool that was a 
            vertical assortment of the content of the specific page you were on. For example if you were on the BlOGS homepage, it would vertically list 
            all the blogs you could visit. That vertical list would be a consistent throughout every page, it would just change form. I struggled carrying over
            this idea to newer version of my website because it didn't allow for much travel between content pages that weren't related. For example you couldnt go from 
            blog post 3 to the design section. Users would have to go to the blog homepage then the homepage then into design, a much longer process and one that could frustrate users.
            I do still like the look of one nav bar sort of staying in the center of the homepages of the website, the visual consistent would create an almost flipbook nature 
            to my site which has the exact quirky character I'm still interested in having my site. I just have to think of a way to go about in which the traversal of my site
            is still cohesive and efficient.

            <ul>
            <li>What I'm proud of: Im proud of having my pages and them linking to one another. Just the idea of a working website being something I created means a lot to 
                me. I'm just proud this exists. I'm proud of how comfortable Ive gotten with making additions to my site whenever needed, I haven't struggled with a 
                lot and I'm happy for it.
            </li>
            <li>
                What I struggled with: The pathing of my pages was a huge hurdle and gave me a lot of frustration when making this site. This week alone I had to remake an entire
                folder for my blogs as well as each blog page file because 404s kept popping up when they were linked. Matter in fact my entire folder strcutre was re done because this issue.
                it was especially frustrating because in visual studio code, the links would work perfectly, but on the site nothing but 404s.
