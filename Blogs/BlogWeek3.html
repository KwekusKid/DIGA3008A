<h4>User Alignment</h4> 
<p>To talk about my user alignment I first want to identify and define my target audiences, their expectations, the behaviors and experiences I want
    them to have on this website. My target audiences, first and foremost will always be those looking into my works and product. In terms of how I want their expectations, behaviors and experience 
    to go I want them to find a well structured and intuitive website. I want structure and consistency to be the base of my website for users 
    who aren't there for a more conceptual experience or users who are new to the culture around my work and the space that I inhabit as an artist. A well structured 
    website will encourage users to explore more parts of my website because of its ease and formatting, allowing them to get greater understanding of who I am as an artist and 
    what I can produce.</p> 

    <p>Expanding on my user alignment and site content. To deeper define my target audience, I want creative and open minded users on my site.
        users that are open to experimentation and expression. A top of what I mentioned about having a well structured and intuitive website to 
        encourage exploration, however, I still do want my website to tell a story, to embody an experience and to embody a place specifically. The place is the most important to me. 
        I want my website to share the same feeling and experience of a place dedicated to the maintaining of pieces that will eventually be archives. 
        Museums, art galleries and the criterion closet all come to mind. In a more digital context websites like the official site for mubi, Martin Rose and Wales Bonner
        main pages also apple to this. Theses spaces are created to serve the pieces, display their pieces in their most organic form and create worlds 
        where these pieces are best reflected and translated.   
    </p>

    <p>The characteristics of these spaces and how I can bring them to my website: 
        <ul>
            <li>Space: Space is a huge part of what makes art art. The ability to create room and time for users to experience and take in
                what they're viewing is a crucial step in getting them immersed in your world and your creations and the sites and places I mentioned
                make sure they use space so well. Sites like the Martin Rose main page the portfolio of photographers Deon Hinton, all incorporate huge 
                image backgrounds as well as white as the main colour of the site. While it may not seem like it the colour white players a huge part in creating 
                space. White does 3 things to "create space", it reflects light, provides a clean backdrop as well leaves room for more attention to be on any other colours 
                nearby, and especially in this case, pieces or artworks that will be on my site. 
            </li>

            <li>Huge images and barely any user interface: These website tend to let the images be large and loud. Enwrapping the users in their world and 
                aesthetics and designs. A challenge I will be facing is finding a balance between expressing the world and location I want for my website 
                while still following principles of effective web design because a lot of my favourite website wouldn't be seen as the most 
                user centric experiences. More so that they create an experience and users are invited.
            </li>
        
        </ul>
        I go more into depth as well as have direct links to my inspirations in my design section <a href = "/DesignPages/./Design.html">DESIGN</a>

        <h4>Site content and User Interface</h4>
        <img src = "../DesignPages/Content structure.png" alt="Content Mapping" width = "500" height = "500">

        <p>Interface elements I'm considering:
            <ul>
                <li>A collapsing home navigation bar: A home bar that will be on every page throughout the website that can send them anywhere else
                    throughout the website. The collapsing aspect of it allows for more pages to have more space, allowing in more space into the pages.  </li>
                    <li>The image zoom effect: Images where the mouse hovers over they zoom in, I want this in my website so users are able to quickly and smoothly 
                        identify details in my works.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some sort of trail that helps users know what part of the website they're on: This will be illustrated in the collapsing home nav bar
                        either through it showing the section your as a blank word rather than a link or not having the section your in the nav bar at all.
                    </li>
            </ul>

    <h4>Reflections, URL scheme and semantic markup</h4>
 
    <p>In terms of semantic markup, I want to look at the use of article and section. A huge part my site are my weekly dev blogs, which tend to
        quite long pieces of writing that need to be formatted and organized. I use the article tag mainly to structure the entire pages of each blog post
        and within each article I break down shifts in terms of content using sections. For example if a posts asks us to speak on the 4 seasons, each season would
        be discussed in its own section while all 4 within 1 article tag. When sectioning within sections themselves, my go tos are usually the paragraph and unordered list with list items.
        Lists are needed when Im breaking a topic up into multiple short points and I used the paragraphs when I find the topic of a section quite dense and having multiple factors to considers but each factor is much denser than
        one I'd use a list for. Ironically an example are the 2 paragraphs for this SECTION of the post because yes I believe I am talking about multiple 
        topics, URL scheme and Semantic Markup, each topic is too dense for me just put them in a list. List are fast points meant to be digested quickly. And I feel 
        a break down of these two topics wouldn't be translated best in those restraints.
    </p>

    <p>URL Scheme, I want to  have an efficient and easy to process URL scheme on my website. Much like what I spoke about in  my user alignment section, I want 
        my url scheme to carry the same principles of a solid effective foundation of this website, encouraging exploration and allowing for time and space to open the mind
        I think with that its important users know which part of the website their own and can tell whether they look at the home bar or the URL. Overall structure and consistency are key for
        me when designing this website.
