        <h3 class = "p-category"> My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to pages</h3>
        <p>- Navigating GitHub is still a challenge, I feel I never got to understand it from a fundamental standpoint. I have a lot of questions, like what is pages? I dont really understand what publishing really means, and many more embarrassing ones.
        I do think all of it is cool, just the idea of coding an entire website from scratch excites me and I'm pretty to excited to learn about that process.
    I did learn that Github is a little slow to update my pages.

        <h3 class = "p-category">Reflections on the readings and my experience of the internet today</h3>
        <p>
            The readings I selected was 'proposal for a universal electronic system and archive(from literary machines 1981)'. This reading looked at and expanded on the idea presented by Ted Nelson of a ever expanding computer network that contains all the literature of the world. Basically the worlds greatest archive, it explores how the network would be made on both a technical and conceptual level. He called the project Xanadu and wanted it to hold all literature. And to explore that the reading looked into what literature is and the idea of a linkage system.
         I really enjoyed how the reading defined literature as ongoing system of interconnecting documents. They talked about how all literature is connected even to the point of a child simply writing something on a piece of paper, because even what they wrote still comes from somewhere. That really shifted my perspective on writing and on a grander scale how I view humanity as a whole and our constant ability to learn and grow as a result of our connections to one another.
         <p>To connect all these different strains of literature, the reading explores the idea of a linkage system as well as a Electronic literary systems. Linkage systems were seen as invisible lines that connect different documents together. Think of the search bar feature on Tiktok. When on Tiktok and a video pops, if during that video and throughout the video's comment section a certain group of words or topic is brought up a significant amount of times then users have an easy way to search up said topic through two options. One is a grey search bar at the bottom of the video that when pressed by a user will automatically search the words on tiktok. And the other option is if a comment under the video clearly states the words/topic then it will become a blue comment which users can click on to instantly search tiktok for the words or topic. 
            Weather or not users find exactly what they're looking for is another issue but I think this form of hypermedia is exactly what Ted wanted for his linkage system of Xanadu.</p> 
        <p>
            Another topic discussed in the reading I also really enjoyed was the idea of an electronic literary system. One thing the reading said about this system was that they wanted it to be simple and easy for users to navigate 
            which I found really cool as a design goal because even now in 2025, 20 years since Nelsons theory was released and even more since the release of <i>literary machines 1981</i> that has always been the goal of those involved in interactive media and user interface. But speaking on what the literary system was. Nelson wanted it that each document not only had multiple copies being easy to access and trace but every change and version to be tracked and saved as well. He believed this would be vital in developing literature as it would allow authors to expand on and look at the different possibilities and shapes all their writing could take.
           He wanted that changes and different versions of documents had their own index. This also applied to ideas beyond literature, pictures, videos as well as graphical data structures were to all have the system in place.

    <h3>The internet archive</h3>
    <p>
        Overall I don't have that much to speak on in terms of my experience on the internet, I google words I don't understand and read articles my sister or tiktok recommends me. thats pretty much me summed up as a user of the internet. however I really do lime the idea of cool interesting corners of the internet.
     websites that are underground and sort of obscure for example, window snap. A site where people just live stream their windows and where their are, if they choose to, I love sites discovering sites like this and it makes me wish I sort of grew up on the internet more. But one site I really wanted to talk about and as a result of the readings was Internet Archive, which is a non-profit digital library filled with millions of texts, audios, pictures and more 
     its used by academics, researchers and the public. Its mission is to provide universal access to knowledge.  
     Though, instinctually you'd want to compare The Xanadu project and Internet archive. It wouldn't be that necessary both sites might offer the same service of retain information dated backed decades and sometimes centuries however what I've found is that Internet Archive is more focused on preserving websites and softwares and all their versions using the Wayback Machine 
    while The Xanadu project is focused on literture and all its versions. 
    in terms of interesting things I learnt, Internet Archive is under massive lawsuits from different publishing groups regardings the books on the site and recently had to take down over 500 thousand readings off their site
    which was a huge blow for readers who don't have the access to these readings and need them for academic or research use.

        <h3 class = "p-category">My goals for the course</h3>
        <p>-The first is just to be very comfortable on computers, beyond just understanding code and Git. I just want to adopt
            good tech and computer practices, normal shorcuts, extensions on my chrome. I've never been the most tech savy guy so I'd really love to be
            able to navigate technology and the internet a lot better by the end of this course.(I sometimes still look at my keyboard when I type)<br>
            -The next thing would be to be efficient at the coding languages at this course as well as be very comfortable with github and understand it on a fundamental level and all its safe practices<br>
            -To create a portfolio that translates me the best as an artist.
