                   Aware of context, an internet that understands your location, identity and connects you with contexts that elevate and change your experiences on this planet for the better in real time. 
                   Algorithms are far from their cold apathetic and profit driven but instead complex and aware of ethical standards that are constantly being reviewed, restructured and maintained. 
                   Search results shouldn't be affected by colonial economic differences, data collected for AI training modals should be contextual and objective. 
                   Essentially an internet for all to see and share and experience.
