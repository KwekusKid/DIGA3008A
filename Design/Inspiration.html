<h5>What I like</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
    Throughout my last two blogs, and my web design process. I speak on the idea of creating a world 
   for users to visit, and using visuals and good spacing to allow for when users do open my website to experience they are launched straight
   into that world. This website is why I'm so stuck on that concept, the background visuals are not explained no giving small captions that description when
   or why they were taken or even put on the website in the first place. This creates a sense that this world existed before you came here and it will exist and change after.
   Matter of fact these images changed from the first time I checked this website for inspiration, and not in a way that they are randomized for every visit to the, more
   so in a sense that an event has happened for the organization of Martine rose, an event that called for the images to change. That sort of real world effect is what I hope to have
   for my website, letting users know that, my art, my brand will change weather you're watching or not. This theme is littered all throughout the site and its a characteristic I want to have in mine.

   </li>

   <li>It breaks the rules yet I am still drawn in: A disclaimer, I am a huge fan of Martine rose, her brand, its ethos and even the celebrities spotted in the clothing.
    I feel I identify with its ability to really craft an authentic identity in such a saturated market like fashion. And I feel like it gets this love from me because it breaks conventions of fashion constantly
    and I love how they brought that characteristic here on their website. For example sometimes their home bar will disappear as a result of it having the same 
    colour of the visuals behind it, sometimes theres a bit of a visual inconsistency between the store portion of the site and the rest of the site. The store sections
    is in line with most fashion brands sites. For these rules to broken however, I feel like conventions of websites are challenged, for example how they approach the home bar, it still remains at the top but instead of having one 
    colour in the spaces between options, they choose instead to leave the spaces between the options transparent. This decision, though not revolutionary, is huge in immersing viewers into their world, the site feels more fluid in the long 
    run and the traversal easier.

    <h5>What I don't like</h5>

    <p>This could all just be lazy web design and I just don't have the eyes or knowledge on the subject to tell. As said before a lot of this website
     does not follow rules of web design, fonts disappear into visuals, the homebar navigation tool is occasionally buggy and the spacing in the home page isn't balanced well. 
     The site has its flaws that can sometimes get in the way of navigating it. This is an issue I hope to address in my site, a goal of mine is to achieve a distinct look and world to my site 
     while the websites functionality and fluid lie at its foundation.

    <h3>Websites that are inspirational</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Internet Archive: <a href="https://archive.org" target="_blank">The Internet Archive</a>, the internet archive
            from a UI design perspective,
            has the look and a feel of library. This is inspirational because I want my website to embody a place, I just
            haven't figured out what type of place.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deon Hinton Portfolio: <a href="https://www.okdeon.com/about" target="_blank">Deon Hinton Portfolio</a>, Deon
            Hinton, is one my favourite working photographers today and with his portfolio,
            much like the Internet Archive, Deon's portfolio has the look of an art gallery. Its artistic and peaceful.
