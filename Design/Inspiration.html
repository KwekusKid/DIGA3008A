                                    <ul>
                                        <li>

                                            Throughout my last two blogs, and my web design process. I speak on the idea
                                            of creating a world
                                            for users to visit, and using visuals and good spacing to allow for when
                                            users do open my website to experience they are launched straight
                                            into that world. This website is why I'm so stuck on that concept, the
                                            background visuals are not explained no giving small captions that
                                            description when
                                            or why they were taken or even put on the website in the first place. This
                                            creates a sense that this world existed before you came here and it will
                                            exist and change after.
                                            Matter of fact these images changed from the first time I checked this
                                            website for inspiration, and not in a way that they are randomized for every
                                            visit to the, more
                                            so in a sense that an event has happened for the organization of Martine
                                            rose, an event that called for the images to change. That sort of real world
                                            effect is what I hope to have
                                            for my website, letting users know that, my art, my brand will change
                                            weather you're watching or not. This theme is littered all throughout the
                                            site and its a characteristic I want to have in mine.



                                        </li>

                                        <li>
                                            It breaks the rules yet I am still drawn in: A disclaimer, I am a huge fan
                                            of Martine rose, her brand, its ethos and even the celebrities spotted in
                                            the clothing.
                                            I feel I identify with its ability to really craft an authentic identity in
                                            such a saturated market like fashion. And I feel like it gets this love from
                                            me because it breaks conventions of fashion constantly
                                            and I love how they brought that characteristic here on their website. For
                                            example sometimes their home bar will disappear as a result of it having the
                                            same
                                            colour of the visuals behind it, sometimes theres a bit of a visual
                                            inconsistency between the store portion of the site and the rest of the
                                            site. The store sections
                                            is in line with most fashion brands sites. For these rules to broken
                                            however, I feel like conventions of websites are challenged, for example how
                                            they approach the home bar, it still remains at the top but instead of
                                            having one
                                            colour in the spaces between options, they choose instead to leave the
                                            spaces between the options transparent. This decision, though not
                                            revolutionary, is huge in immersing viewers into their world, the site feels
                                            more fluid in the long
                                            run and the traversal easier.

                                    </ul>


                                    <h5>What I don't like</h5>

                                    <p>This could all just be lazy web design and I just don't have the eyes or
                                        knowledge on the subject to tell. As said before a lot of this website
                                        does not follow rules of web design, fonts disappear into visuals, the homebar
                                        navigation tool is occasionally buggy and the spacing in the home page isn't
                                        balanced well.
                                        The site has its flaws that can sometimes get in the way of navigating it. This
                                        is an issue I hope to address in my site, a goal of mine is to achieve a
                                        distinct look and world to my site
                                        while the websites functionality and fluid lie at its foundation.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>Talking on the IxD of the website, I just wanted to highlight some interface
                                        elements and details I really liked.</p>
                                    <section>
                                        <p>

                                            The MARTIN ROSE: I really like that clicking on the name of the website
                                            takes you back to the homepage and when you hover over it
                                            it goes into a little box and uses normal capital letters.


                                        </p>
                                        <p>

                                            The archive and shop navigation tool: Throughout the website you are able to
                                            access any collection in rose's archive as well as any item in their shop.
                                            They do this by leaving the words
                                            archive and shop atop of any page within the sites invisible homebar. When a
                                            user hovers over each word a black rectangle appears covering anything thaat
                                            the site was showing in the space.
                                            Within the square pops up all relevant pieces necessary to the option you've
                                            decided to look at, so if you hovered over archive, collections will appear.
                                            This black square sort of functions as a navigation tool and I really like
                                            how slick yet bold it is, it carries characteristics that resonate well with
                                            the brand.


                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The capitalizing of letters to let users know they're highlighting over
                                            something: I like the odd look of lowercase letters from start to finish.
                                            And I love how the website
                                            flips that to use capitalizing as a way to create visual literacy for users.

                                    luxury, a fusion of European heritage with an Afro Atlantic spirit.

                                    <p>

                                        I love that the themes of her brand translate so well onto her page. Cultural
                                        luxury bleeds off this page so well, the use of vertical alignment, white spaces
                                        and
                                        balance all come together for an art gallery look. Using huge images of her
                                        pieces, Bonner allows for her works to provide the colour and pop of her site,
                                        this is a great decision and shines throughout the site.

                                    <p>

                                        Once again I'm a huge fan of the lack of homebar on this,this is an experience
                                        first and a website second and that experience being of class and elegance. I
                                        love that her name much like the Martine Rose site
                                        serves as the home button. It's just such a classy website and I cant gush about
                                        it enough.


                                    </p>

                                        The stripped back approach to the letters and overall design: In my <a
                                            href="../Blogs/BlogWeek3.html"> Week 3 blog post</a> I speak about the
                                        importance
                                        of a website creating space, in order for users to take in the experieacne the
                                        website is trying to offer them as well as the pieces and works on display
                                        specifically on a
                                        website that centers around someones work. Wales Bonner is a excellent display
                                        of how stripped back IxD can help carry and represent a brand identity and
                                        culture. Elegance is term
                                        I understand as stylish without trying and I feel that is presented in this
                                        site, through its lowercase lettering, Godfrey font and minimalistic approach to
                                        its interface elements.
                                        Bonner's site stands as a closer testament to a perfect balance between good web
                                        design and brand identity than even my favourite Martine rose.

                                    picked cinema that elevates the medium. It has a hand selected list of films, that
                                    range from avant

                                <p>
                                    I just wanted to switch mediums of discussion when it comes to the websites I enjoy
                                    from fashion to film. Mubi much like the Wales Bonner site takes a minimalistic
                                    approach to its design
                                    again focusing on creating space for the works on display to shine. What I love
                                    about Mubi specifically though is its dedication to cinema. When you pick what movie
                                    you want to watch, the site
                                    will display:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Multiple credited reviews, such as the new yorker, on the film


                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        The films cast and production team


                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        Articles related to the film within the film scene


                                    </li>
                                    <li>

                                        Film industry awards the film as received along sides places the film is being
                                        shown



                                    </li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    And many more details. That attention to detail is something I want to bring over to
                                    the research and portfolio aspects of my website.
                                    Overall I'm just a huge fan of how Mubi as a site feels like the biggest film nerd I
                                    know. The UI is littered with different movie stills, and the colours of the movie
                                    stills pop so well
                                    with the use of the white background.

                                </p>

                                    haven't figured out what type of place. It also works with with my user align

                                    The typography I'm looking to implement in my website are Times New Roman for
                                    written
                                    text and Helvetica for
                                    headings and sub headings
                                    they're both timeless and recognizable and will help me in achieving a minimalistic
                                    look
                                    for my site.
                                </p>

                                    I want to avoid having a nav bar and instead I'm choosing a collapsing menu to try
                                    go
                                    for a more
                                    minimalistic look.
                                    a really important goal for my website was to use space as my visuals.

                                    The colours I'm going are between the shades of black and white. I find they both
                                    are
                                    excellent space
                                    handlers and allow for UI elements
                                    to get spotted quicker. If I do involve colours it would probably be different
                                    shades of
