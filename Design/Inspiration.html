    <h3>Websites that are inspirational</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Internet Archive: <a href="https://archive.org" target="_blank">The Internet Archive</a>, the internet archive
            from a UI design perspective,
            has the look and a feel of library. This is inspirational because I want my website to embody a place, I just
            haven't figured out what type of place.

        <li>
            Deon Hinton Portfolio: <a href="https://www.okdeon.com/about" target="_blank">Deon Hinton Portfolio</a>, Deon
            Hinton, is one my favourite working photographers today and with his portfolio,
            much like the Internet Archive, Deon's portfolio has the look of an art gallery. Its artistic and peaceful.
