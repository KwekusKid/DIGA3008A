    <p>Homepage Wireframe: I want the entire site to be linked through the home page. The homepage itself wont have a
        lot of information. It's
        main function will be navigation
    </p>
    <p>Blogs Wireframe: This format should be on all pages. I want the consistency to help users understand the
        navigation of the site</p>
    
    <p>The home bar being collapsing and throughout every page on the website is a feature I wanted to embed in website to allow for easy traversing on my website

<h4>Homepage Wireframes</h4>
<img src = "../Images/Wireframes/HomePageWireframe.png" alt = "Homepage Wireframe" width = "600" height = "500">

<p>New Homepage wireframe and Design: With this wireframe I am starting to develop the potential visual structure of my site and how that could be achieved.
    I wanted to achieve a clean look and something thats easy to navigate for users. For now Im not too interested in visuals but in the long run I do want my 
    website to reflect a place or at least a feeling. However I do believe the foundation for my concept for this website needs to be an effective and easy website to go in and around.

<h4>Design wireframe</h4>

<p>
    Design section Wireframes and Designs: When designing this section of my website, I found it difficult to balance between having that clean open look that a lot of my
    inspirations have with out making my website look boring. I knew that I wanted to separate the sections of my wireframes and inspirations because both topics will hold a lot
    of content, for further context, in the near future I'm thinking of changing the name of the wireframe page to my web design page to expand the discussion to more than just wireframes but also
    the colours theories, imagery and overall art direction I'm hoping to take the website in. In terms of will be in the blocks/thumbnails of each section and why theres an inclusion of that in the first place,
    I want the design pages of this website to be a visual place, where imagery is the main language. In terms what the thumbnails will be I am thinking either between a collage of the most relevant pieces related to that section at the time
    for example a collage of my latest wireframes, or I'm thinking a mini slide show or moving of images throughout the most relevant pieces. For example when the mouse cursor hovers over the 
    inspirations thumbnail, a mini slide show of my latest and most significant references will begin.

<p>  
    When thinking about the design of my blog post section's wireframe and design, I really fell in love with the idea of coloumn based writing.
     Wiriting that was formatted horizontally while vertically spaced. This type of layout gives the feel of an old newspaper, a look that I've
    always found satisfying and stylish. In terms of my IxD approach the interface elements I'm thinking of employing are the focus effect from netflix's UI. When on Netflix
and you hover your cursor over a show, the show tab increases in size over the rest of the shows next to it to give viewers a better look and more description about the show, in most
cases a trailer will begin playing. How I wanted to implement this for my blogs section is on the homepage for blogs. I want there to be 4 of my most recent blogs and each blog
will have synopsis that will almost serve as a thumbnail for viewers of the site. Then when users hover over each blog, a bigger mini screen will pop with the introduction of the blog. There will also be a "see all"
link that will generate a full list of all my blogs. I also made sure that the blog post list would be in order from left to right for visual literacy and I chose to always show 4 blogs for visual symmetrical balance.

<h4>Portfolio wireframes </h4>
  
<p>
<img src = "../Images/Wireframes/Portfolio Wireframe .png" alt = "Portfolio Wireframe 1"  width = "400" height = "400">
<img src = "../Images/Wireframes/Portfolio Wireframe 2.png" alt = "Portfolio Wireframe 2 with open expanded interface elements" width = "400" height = "400">
</p>

<p>
Portfolio wireframe and design: I decided on the heading of "works" because I feel that best represents what the content of my portfolio will be. I choose to 
position the works title on the left instead of the center because I felt it worked better for the balance of the page. For me it show that the term of
works literally equates to work in games, photography and film. In terms of interface elements, my collapsing home navigation bar is ever present. I also want to
integrate a collapsing nature to each form of work, so when users click on games, for example,  a list of the 3 most relevant games at the time will pop up and from there users can click
on a specific game to go straight to its itch, steam or any location where they can find the game. An issue that arises however, is fitting in a place where users can click that displays all the work of a specific 
field between film, photography and games. I'm leaning towards after the down arrow is clicked next to the field, a fourth smaller in font option comes up saying "see all".

    <h4>Profile wireframes</h4>

    <p> Reference to Martine rose's about section <a href = https://martine-rose.com/en-us/pages/about> Martine rose about</a> </p>

<!-- <p>

    Profile wireframes and design: Martine rose's website is huge inspiration in terms of where I want my website to go, instead of following the rules 
    of traditional web design, rose forces viewers into her world and makes them get comfortable with that, this is shown best in her about page. Instead of a
    profile filled with linkedin and other applications icons/links dedicated to networking, rose decides to tell her story. A story she feels best represents 
    her, more than any link could ever. In terms of design and user interface, the page has that column approach that I mentioned in my blog post wireframe section. 
    I think going with this approach to how your writing is represented creates a feeling of being grounded. Columns like this have been used in print media for ages 
    and to see it on the website brings an authentic feeling to your website, a feeling I want to be a characteristic of my website. There aren't too many interface elements on the 
    page itself besides her home bar at the top, which disappears when your school far down enough, overall the page is quite stripped back but I love this approach
    as it leads back to the concept of space and how much I value it in my website, I speak on that more in my week three blog <a href = "../Blogs/BlogWeek3.html">here</a>. 
    When designing my site I thought it'd be important that it retain that stripped back feel while also being easy to navigate.
