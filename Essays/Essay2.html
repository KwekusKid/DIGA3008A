        <section class="Paragraph">
            <p>
                In today’s digital age of social media, information has never been easier to not only access but spread.
                Several platforms allow billions of user’s accesses to quick and easy personalized information. However,
                a
                question does arise of the information’s legitimacy, because as much as these platforms can hold
                discussion
                for scientific facts, studies and well documented information, they also leave room for opinions,
                discourse
                and most importantly misinformation. This essay aims to look at the negative effects of this
                misinformation
                specifically on marginalised communities online. Specifically, the case study for this discussion will
                be
                the narrative of the “white genocide” happening in South Africa. This case study will be investigated
                through lens digital divisions and shadows; terms used in Society and the Internet: How Networks of
                Information and Communication are Changing Our Lives () by M. Graham and W.H. Dutton. To begin, it would
                be
                worthwhile to discuss what misinformation in the digital age looks like.

            <h3>The Age of Misinformation</h3>
        </section>

        <section class="Paragraph">
            <p>
                Misinformation is the defined as the act of giving false information. The age of misinformation however
                is
                much
                more complex. Max Fisher of The New York times writes “We are in an era of endemic misinformation — and
                outright
                disinformation.” (Fisher, 2021) He goes on to explain how there are psychology factors that come into
                play
                into
                the spreading of misinformation. However, throughout this essay they’ll be a focus on the role the
                digital
                divide plays in the spreading of both misinformation and disinformation due to factors like the lack of
                representation online. While not the focus of the essay, disinformation is another term that will be
                mentioned
                throughout, and the difference between misinformation and disinformation is the user’s intent, while
                misinformation focuses on the accuracy of the information, disinformation has the purpose to mislead.

        </section>

        <section class="Paragraph">
            <p>
                Examples of disinformation can be found within the first case study, the spreading of the agenda of a
                white
                genocide in South Africa. Though not a relatively new topic, discussions of a possible genocide of white
                South African farmers has recently sparked a lot of discussion due to its real world impact. In May
                2025,
                President Cyril Ramaphosa attended a meeting at the white house with Donald Trump. The meeting was
                centred
                around South African political party, AfriForum, claim of white South African farmers being killed
                disproportionally to the rest of the population. This resulted in massive political tension between
                South
                Africa and the United States causing major socio-economic implications such as the removal of USAID out
                of
                the country, a service dedicated to funding programs on HIV/AIDS in South Africa. M.Graham speaks on the
                idea of the whether the amount of content being created online in different places is changing over
                time. He
                looks at the increasing rate of African and Asian users on large platforms like Facebook. He then goes
                on to
                explain how that has a temporal shift on the platforms where these users create content. This shift
                effects
                a wide variety content on these platforms, for example with the introduction of South African users on
                to
                the platform TikTok, Amapiano, a popular genre of music out of South Africa, has taken the app by storm.
                A
                wider range of new users brings new perspectives to spaces related, to art, science and specifically
                psychology.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the second inauguration of President Donald Trump, radical right spaces began to gain real traction
                online, this, alongside the rise of anti-intellectualism online became an issue that spread worldwide.
                Related to this is the fact that there is uneven production of digital information distributed across
                different geographies (Graham, 2014). Meaning Western and powerful nations such as the US tend to
                dominate
                online spaces. This played a huge role in connecting right wing radical thought spaces of the US to the
                same
                spaces in South Africa. This coincided with political controverses, such as the recent land
                expropriation
                act, comments made between political party the EFF’s leader Julius Malema and Tesla and X owner Elon
                Musk
                who at the time had close relations to Donald Trump. These major political incidents invited a lot of
                discourse surrounding the state of the political relationship between South Africa and the United
                States.
                These discourses drew a bridge between the countries radicalized right wing and specifically for actors
                spreading the narrative of a “white genocide” in South Africa. Despite this connection between these
                thought
                spaces not necessarily causing a temporal shift for social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok, the
                discourse and conversations held as a result, caused real world implications that effected real world
                people
                and communities. Specifically, those of marginalised communities. According to UNAID, the removal of
                USAID
                resulted in major service disruptions, clinics were closed and vulnerable groups such as adolescent
                girls,
                young women and, pregnant women were left at risk to no access to necessary HIV prevention medications
                like
                PrEP.

                In Making a Feminist Internet in Africa: Why The Internet needs African Feminists and Feminism, writer
                Sheena
                Magenya predicts a world in which after the covid 19 virus pandemic and its subsequent socio-political
                effects.
                “Without enough voices of reason and care for difference and diversity, we are in danger of people
                emerging
                a
                month after quarantine more conservative and more radicalised than before, through accessing an internet
                that
                represents a dominant and oppressive minority.” (Magenya, 2020) Despite missing the window of the covid
                19
                lockdown to expose the internet to more voices of reason and diversity, Magenya’s claim still holds
                true.
                Without these voices involved in the discourse of what was occurring between the US and South Africa,
                real
                world
                actions were taken, and vulnerable communities were affected. Another factor to consider are the data
                shadows of
                South Africa and specifically this topic. Data shadows refer to the layers of digital information about
                places
                (Graham, 2014). Despite conversations and discourse happening on different social media platforms like
                Twitter
                and Tiktok related to the political tension between the US and South Africa and USAID, alternative
                spaces
                online, including journalistic sites and other media-based platforms didn’t have much information to
                offer
                on
                these topics. This lack of real representation across a wide range of online platforms resulted in even
                more
                disinformation to be spread as a political tool for radical right-wing supporters.

                The age of misinformation reveals fractures in the online digital space, fractures that have the
                potential
                to disproportionately harm marginalized communities. When global narratives are shaped by dominant,
                Western
                voices, misinformation even has the potential to be a political tool. As shown in the “white genocide”
                narrative, disinformation can spill into geopolitics with life-threatening consequences. The withdrawal
                of
                USAID in South Africa was not just a political outcome, but a humanitarian one, resulting in the harming
                and
                risk of young and vulnerable women battling AIDS in South Africa. Without meaningful participation from
                diverse and local voices online, especially African feminists as Magenya urges, these injustices will
                persist. Only by confronting digital inequalities through platform reform, digital literacy, and
                supporting
                real online local representation, can we begin to build an internet that safeguards rather than
                threatens
                the communities most in need of its protection.
