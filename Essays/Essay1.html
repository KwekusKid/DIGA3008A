        <section class="Paragraph">
            <p>
                BROKE is a streetwear fashion brand made in 2020 by the art collective BROKE BOY$. A brand that focuses
                on
                clean, sleek and minimal fashion that’s translated in their modern and aesthetic website,
                sobroke.online.
                A current pioneer of youth culture in South African, an analysis on its UX and UI will help future
                identities in navigating the ever growing and changing digital space.

            <h3>UI, UX and ethics in web design</h3>
        </section>


        <section class="Paragraph">
            <p>
                To look at the BROKE website on a UI and UX level, I first want to discuss and define, UI and UX not
                only as
                concepts but as well as in other fashion websites. Looking at fashion sites conventions, goals and
                user’s
                alignments and from there compare and analyse how does BROKE shape up and achieve its goals as a company
                within their website. One consistent feature I found throughout several fashion websites was minimalism,
                in
                the article a guide to minimalist design, Ismail Elazizi speaks on minimalism as a design or style
                “which
                the simplest and fewest elements are used to create maximum effect.” The act of stripping away to
                highlight
                what is important to the design. Minimalism leaks into a designer’s process when they go about the UI
                and UX
                of their product but as well as their ethical UX design. Aparna K S in Ethical UX Design and User Trust:
                Why
                does it Matter defines Ethical UX design as “When businesses strike a delicate balance between achieving
                their objectives and prioritizing their user’s needs” , while minimalism is a staple of fashion
                websites,
                its use of high-quality images is not always the most accessible, and a question is raised, can the
                website
                be accessed and engaged with a wide range of users. UI and UX refers to a user interface and experience
                respectively. User interface is the point of interaction between the user and product, it is a strictly
                digital, in The Difference Between UX and UI Design: A Beginner’s Guide, Emil Lamprecht explains “UI
                focuses
                on the look, feel, presentation, and interactivity of a digital product. Its goal is efficiency and
                effectiveness in translating the purpose of the digital product.” While UI’s goal is efficiency, User
                Experience speaks to experience and the feel of the product.
                Whether digital or not UX refers to the experience a designer wants the users to have when interacting
                with
                the product. In this context we’ll mainly be speaking on whether sobroke.
                Online achieves alignment between its user experience and company ethos all under the umbrella of
                ethical
                interaction design.

            <h3>Fashion websites and their conventions</h3>
        </section>

        <section class="Paragraph">
            <p>
                Wales Bonner, Olive Clothing and even another South African website in Thebe Magugu were fashion house
                websites I looked at in sample when finding UI and UX conventions across fashion websites.
                These are the patterns I noticed across this sampling.

        <section class="Paragraph">

            <p>
                BROKE’s website handles space excellently, using it quite sparely but also very accurately, in the sense
                that white spaces are holders for point of interaction on the website, whether it be their navigation
                bar at
                the top left or in the center of their home page where users can find a description of what and who
                BROKE
                are as a company and their ethos.
                Negative space is not only used to highlight visuals that translate the brand but also navigate users to
                points of interaction on the website, killing two birds with one stone. In terms of ethics, BROKE
                balances
                their negative space and visuals well enough to not demand a lot from users in terms of internet speed,
                yes
                their homepage has a lot of high spec images, however the rest of the site, their blog page for example
                features small and few pictures that are only their to serve a purpose of translating exactly what the
                blog
                post is speaking on. The website also has efficient responsive design, carrying over their clean and
                sleek
                ethos across multiple devices allowing for a wider range of users. One flaw I would point out is that
                the
                website could use more visuals to bring over more of the experience that BROKE is. Relating it more to
                physical spaces the company owns, for example the BROKE Klubhouse or their 199-loop store. When speaking
                on
                their visit there, Holly Beaton, writer for Bubblegum, a South African blog website that looks at youth
                pop
                culture across the country. Beaton highlighted how “199 Loop is a hub with homies hanging around,
                talking
                about music, fashion and culture.” I mentioned before how the brand of BROKE was conceived from a
                collective, BROKE BOY$, to take this website to the next level, its important they translate the
                identity of
                the collective more, its roots not only in fashion, but music, the arts and culture overall.
                They do this with the addition of a blog section, but even more steps could be taken. Speaking on
                experiences and fashion websites another pattern I wanted to speak on is that of a balance between
                experience and market.

            <p>
                When looking across a sample to understand what makes a good or bad fashion website, I found a lot of
                the
                ones I didn’t like struggled with balance between being an experience of a site and a market. Either the
                site got lost in its visuals and the navigation of the store was frustrating and visually cluttered and
                unorganized or the complete opposite, where majority of the website was the store section not allowing
                for
                users to get drawn into the experience and culture of the brand. I’ve found the best fashion sites
                balance
                between the experience and culture of their brands as well as having a well designed and effective store
                ready for the interaction between the site and the user. A harmony between their UI and UX design
                resulting
                in a process of users not only getting drawn into the brand aesthetically but leaving as satisfied
                customers.
                Bad sites ignore the principle of UX design, with no experience translating an ethos to draw users in,
                nothing connecting them to the clothing alongside that, the worst sites featured unethical persuasive
                design
                practices that Aparna KS spoke on, like the inclusion of tags like “selling fast”, “hot” or other
                non-issues
                to push users to purchase items.

            <p>
                BROKE does not fall victim to this and as a young brand is doing well in this balancing act between
                experience and market. On their home page alone, in terms what the visual layout of the page BROKE
                allows
                their aesthetic and company statement to take center stage of the space, letting users take in not only
                the
                look but the user experience feel of the brand and product, they balance out the UI well by including
                small
                tabs that take you to different sections of the store page. Large images of models in latest BROKE
                pieces in
                aesthetic scenery alongside the company’s mission statement fill up page. This shows the users who and
                what
                BROKE is before the thought of a transaction is even presented, connecting the user to something real, a
                feeling but more importantly an experience. This show don’t tell approach to the homepage design
                alongside
                the inclusion of a blog page, in which itself I find quite ethical because users who aren’t looking to
                spend
                money can still experience something from the site, is what puts BROKE in the conversations of good
                fashion
                websites. Their store section is clean effective and easy to navigate.
                While I do believe and appreciate how well they have achieved this balance of market and experience, I
                do
                feel a few more additions in terms of UX and UI could be done.
            </p>

            <p>
                The mentioned addition of more experience to the site, while I do believe the user experience of
                the site
                does translate a clean fashion brand, it doesn’t translate a wholistic look at the culture of
                BROKE. More
                dedication to that would lead to customer being more drawn into the brand and therefore the
                clothes. Another
                thing is the addition of smarter user interface elements in the homepage, as mentioned, the
                homepage
                features a collection of images of models in a wide range of pieces sold by BROKE. Most fashion
                websites go
                with this approach however, the best include more subtle ways to point users to exactly what is
                being shown
                in the pictures, therefore creating multiple functions for the homepages. Letting viewers gain a
                pull into
                the brands ethos but also giving them easier navigation to the product. The user interfaces I
                identified
                that would help in bridging these issues are simple choices like changing the cursor to a
                pointer when
                hovering over a specific garment or even making the pieces imgs that users can hover over them
                for a small
                description of the piece to come up and leave once users stop hovering over them.
                These small changes would go a long way in creating an immersion experience on the website, one
                that draws
                users in while also being transparent and easy to navigate.

                sobroke.online is a great website and one I am happy is South African. A site that balances
                negative space
                with brand associated visuals and aesthetics, as well a balanced fashion website that respects
                and
                understands the field is, studying and learning their conventions while also trying to bring
                their own
                twists to the industry.
                BROKE, much like their company ethos are attempting to reach the furthest ends of culture, with
                responsive
                UI design, a responsible use of high-quality visuals as well as making UX decisions like the
                addition of a
                blog section to ensure users who aren’t looking to spend still gain something from a visit on
                the site.
                As a young South African, entering the digital space, its inspiring to see pioneers like BROKE
                not only
                navigate principles of UX and UI but also consider the ethics and priorities of their customers.
