    <p>Homepage Wireframe: I want the entire site to be linked through the home page. The homepage itself wont have a
        lot of information. It's
        main function will be navigation
    </p>
    <p>Blogs Wireframe: This format should be on all pages. I want the consistency to help users understand the
        navigation of the site</p>
    <h3>Websites that are inspirational</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Internet Archive: <a href="https://archive.org" target="_blank">The Internet Archive</a>, the internet archive
            from a UI design perspective,
            has the look and a feel of library. This is inspirational because I want my website to embody a place, I just
            haven't figured out what type of place.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deon Hinton Portfolio: <a href="https://www.okdeon.com/about" target="_blank">Deon Hinton Portfolio</a>, Deon
            Hinton, is one my favourite working photographers today and with his portfolio,
            much like the Internet Archive, Deon's portfolio has the look of an art gallery. Its artistic and peaceful.

<h3>Homepage wireframes</h3>
<img src = "Add a heading.png" alt = "Homepage Wireframe" width = "400" height = "500">

<p>New Homepage wireframe: With this wireframe I am starting to develop the potential visual structure of my site and how that could be achieved.
    I wanted to achieve a clean look and something thats easy to navigate for users. For now Im not too interested in visuals but in the long run I do want my 
    website to reflect a place or at least a feeling. However I do believe the foundation for my concept for this website needs to be an effective and easy website to go in and around.

<h3>Design wireframe</h3>

    Design Wireframe: I am struggling with creating consistency between pages while trying to achieve a "clean" look. It results in a lot of pages looking bare in terms of information. 
    And the information that could be added in this would be overwhelming for viewers of the site. The information would need its own section and thats why it didn't make it. This wireframe more so shows 
    the design files homepage, where viewers of the site viewers
