    <p>I am artist whos crafts include video game design, web design and photography. I'm currently studying at the University of Witwatersrand, in my third year as BA in Digital Arts.
         I am majoring in Game Design and Interactive Media. I aim to tell stories across different medias, stories close to both my Tswana and Ghanian roots.
        The translation of my identity and my expressions hold the highest importance to me when it comes to going about any venture I pursue. </p>
